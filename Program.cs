C# Console app assignment:
Create a console app menu with options for running the programs below. Developers make sure your menu repeats until the user chooses to quit.
You will also need to CREATE A MENU CLASS WITH A METHOD FOR EACH PROGRAM BELOW. INCLUDING A METHOD FOR PRINTING THE MENU.

A: Input/Output: Write a program to prompt the user for their name, and greet them by name.
B: Numeric Types: Write a program to calculate the area of a rectangle and print the answer to the console. You should prompt the user for the demensions.
(what data types should the dimensions be?)
C: Numeric types: Write a program that asks a user for the number of miles they have driven and the amount of gas they have consumed(in gallons) and print
their miles per gallon.
D: Strings: The first sentence of Alice's adventures in wonderland is below. Store this sentence in a string, and then prompt the user for a string search
for within this string. Print whether or not the search term was found. See if you can make the search case-insensitive, so that the search for "alice" 
prints true.

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her 
sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'
